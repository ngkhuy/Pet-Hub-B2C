# Consolidated requirements for Python services in this repository
# Generated by an automated scan of imports (best-effort, no pinned versions)
# Notes:
# - Some packages may require extras (e.g. `python-jose[cryptography]`) or specific DB drivers (e.g. `asyncpg`).
# - `pwdlib` was imported in the codebase but is uncommon; include it as-is and verify locally.
# - If you prefer pinned versions, run `pip-compile` or test and pin exact versions.
